/*-------------------------facades----------------------------------*/

1)Facdes bascially use for statically call  service provider method 

For example geolocation is my service and that suppose contain one service 
like serach method
 gelocationfacades::search()


 Auth::login()
 Db::select()
 Route::get()
 view::make()

 --------------------------Session in laravel----

 Request->session->put()

 --------------------------Soft deletes----
Schema::table("posts",function(Blueprint $table){
    $table->softDeletes();
});

Schema::table("posts",function(Blueprint $table){
  $table->dropSoftDeletes();
});

Get,restore and perment delete data
posts::onlyTrashed()->orderBy("id","desc")->take(2)

Restore:
$res= posts::withTrashed()->findOrFail($id);
$res->restore();
PermentDelete:
$res = posts::withTrashed()->findOrFail($id);
$res->forceDelete();
-------------------------------------Json Response--------------------
 return new JsonResponse([
    "data"=>$posts,
 ],400);

------------------------Getter and setter method-----------

getNameAttribute(){

$this->attributes['name']= 
}




 --------------------sleep and __walkup method in php----

 <?php
	class test{
	  public $b;
	  public function __construct(){
	    $this->firstname = "vishal";
	    $this->lastname = "borhade";
	  }
	  
	  public function __sleep(){
	    return array("firstname","lastname");
	  }
	  
	  public function __wakeup(){
	    echo "walk";
	  }
	}
	
	$obj = new test();
	var_dump($obj);
	$res = serialize($obj);
	//unserialize($res);
	var_dump($res);	
?>
------------------------------------Soft Delete----------------
php artisan make::migration alter_posts_table

up(){
	$table->softDelete();
}

down(){
	$table->dropSoftDelete();
}

php artisna migrate: --path = database/migration/2023_10_30_144541_alter_posts_table.php

Inside model use softdelte trait;
use softDelete;

Inside controller

1)Fetch soft delete database
 post::onlyTrashed()
		->orderBy('id','asc')
		->take(2)
		->get();

Restore
$data=post::withTrashed()->findOrFaile($id);\
data->restore();
------------------------------------------
Delte Perment
$data=post::withTrashed()->findOrFaile($id);\
data->restore();

Hookes in Cogniter:=

1)Intialize hookes in = application/config/config.php
$config['enable_hook']="true";

2) application/config/hook.php = write below code 
$hookes["pre_controller"]= [
   "class"=>"mycustomhook"
  "function_name"=>,
  "file_name"=>,
  "params"=>[1,2,3],
]

3)Last step is  = wrtie your hook code in  application/hook/mycustomhook.php

1)post_controller =
a)In this example, the performAction method logs information about the request after the controller 
has processed it. You can customize the logic in the performAction method to suit your application's needs.

b) By following these steps, you can set up a post-controller hook in 
CodeIgniter to perform actions after your controller has handled the incoming request.

2)post_controller_constructor =
a)This is a convenient way to avoid duplicating code in various controller methods to 
  fetch user data from a database or another source.
 you can set up a post_controller_constructor hook in CodeIgniter to perform actions after the 
 controller constructor but before the controller method handles the incoming request.

<?php
class MyHook
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        // Load the user's data and make it available to all controller methods
        $this->loadUserData();
    }

    private function loadUserData()
    {
        // Implement your logic to load user data here
        // For example, you can fetch user information from a database
        // and store it in a property or variable for use in controller methods
    }
}

3)pre_system hook =
By following these steps, you can set up a pre_system hook in CodeIgniter to 
perform actions before the core system and libraries are fully loaded


<?php
class MyHook
{
    public function initializeEnvironment()
    {
        // Your pre-system hook logic goes here
        // For example, you can set configuration values or perform environment setup.
        $this->setEnvironmentVariables();
    }

    private function setEnvironmentVariables()
    {
        // Example: Set environment-specific configuration values
        if (ENVIRONMENT === 'development') {
            // Set debug mode or custom configuration for development environment
            config_item('base_url', 'http://localhost/your_app');
        } elseif (ENVIRONMENT === 'production') {
            // Set production-specific configuration
            config_item('base_url', 'https://yourdomain.com');
        }
    }
}

4) post_system hook =
a)you can set up a post_system hook in CodeIgniter to perform actions 
after the system has completed its processing.
example = log information of  find total execution time of application 

5)Display_override hook =
a) you can set up a Display_override hook in 
CodeIgniter to modify the output of your views before it's sent to the browser.
example  = suppose i want to custom footer before send to browser then i will use this hooke.

How to extend native class in codeniter ?

Inside Application/libraries

Class My_Form_validation extends CI_Form_Validation{

	public function __constrcut(){

	}
}

$this->load->library("My_Form_validation");

--------------------------------------------------
1) How to define variable and their in value in codegniter config and how access in controller

1)first define variable in config  file = application/config/my_config.php

$config["my_variable"] ="This is my configuration value";

Inside controller

$this->config->load('myconfig');

$this->config->item("my_variable");

$config['sess_driver'] = 'files'; // You can use different drivers like 'database', 'memcached', etc.
$config['sess_cookie_name'] = 'ci_session';
$config['sess_expiration'] = 7200; // Se

to load this config item use below code 

$this->config->item(sess_cookie_name);

----------------------------How to use session in CI--------
$this->load->library('session'); 
$this->session->start() ;// if you want to load manually

$this->session->destroy();

$this->session->set_userdata('key',value);
$this->session->userdata('key');
$this->session->unset_userdata('key');

-----oops ------------

interface DatabaseConnection {
    public function connect();
    public function query($sql);
    public function close();
}
--------------------------Rest ApI---
1)cashable
2)code on demand
3)uniform interface
4)stateless (both are independetn and both dont known each other
)
 5)client-server architecture
----------------------------Laravel---------------
